leap-edu-game
=============

A basic leap-based educational game. The game teaches food chain in various ecosystems. It's an attempt to create a new classroom experience for preschool children to actively participate in a lesson. To build it, we based our input on basic leap gestural recognition and the TUIO Reactivision library to recognize fiducials that mark each animal of the game. Each of the recognized gestures or fiducially take the child one step further through both modes of the application/game; the demonstration and the exercise mode.
